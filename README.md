Introduction
At DELI-cious, our customers can fully customize their sandwich orders. Previously, we managed all orders manually on paper. As our business grows, automating the order process and making it available online has become crucial. The goal of this PoS application is to provide an efficient and user-friendly way for customers to place sandwich orders.

Features
The PoS application offers the following features:

Customizable Sandwiches: Customers can order sandwiches in three sizes: 4", 8", and 12". They can choose the type of bread, including white, whole wheat, rye, or wrap.
Toppings: Customers can select regular and premium toppings for their sandwiches. Meats and cheeses are considered premium toppings, while other toppings are regular. Customers can request extra toppings, but premium toppings come at an additional cost.
Toasting: Customers can specify if they want their sandwiches toasted.
Order Management: Customers can place an order with one or more sandwiches. The application displays the order details, including a list of sandwiches with toppings, allowing customers to verify the order's accuracy.
Cost Calculation: The application calculates the total cost of the order, considering sandwich sizes, toppings, and any additional charges.
Receipt Generation: When the customer completes the order, the application generates a receipt file and saves it in the receipts folder. Each order has its own receipt file, named according to the date and time the order was placed.

Installation and Setup
To run the DELI-cious PoS application locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Usage
Upon launching the application, customers will have an intuitive user interface for placing their sandwich orders. They can select a sandwich size, bread type, and toppings, specify if they want it toasted, and add additional sandwiches to their order. Once the order is complete, the application displays the order details and the total cost. After confirmation, a receipt is generated and saved in the receipts folder.
